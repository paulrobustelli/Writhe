WRITHE!!!!!!!
Info 
Writhe.1.py is the updated version script that will, given a trajectory, topology file, outdir, writhe cluster (kmeans), contacts cluster (kmeans) in that order. To run the script, copy it to a folder with the topology and trajectory file. 

The file gives us: 
- Saved Plots and trajectories
- Plots include Eigenvalue 1 and 2 weights, average matrices shown by colormapping values, free energy, and kmeans cluster
- Use the center.txt for locating where each basin corresponds to
- Use the pdb+kmeans_writhe_centroid_step.txt for visualizing on vmd, where the first term is the centroid index for the basin in order of basins

* note that all trajectories for basins were deleted on this branch because of the size *

Here are the paths to the trajectories:
